### Powerups

- Line clear powerup (animation)
- Line powerup should complete goal and give score

### Sounds

- Switch -- bong_001
- Match -- drop_003
- Trophy level up -- maximize_005
- Game start -- switch_002
- Game won -- question_003
- Game over -- select_006

### Music

-- netherplace looping
-- our mountain v003 looping

### Fixes

- Goal not big enough on level 6 (The one surrounded by boulders)
- Score doesn't reset on reloading level ( I think this is fixed )
