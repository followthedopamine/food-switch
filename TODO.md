## High prio

- PlayerPrefs for audio volumes
- Options menu

### Powerups

- Line clear powerup (animation)
- Line powerup should complete goal and give score

### Sounds

- Trophy level up -- maximize_005 (This one kinda sucks)

### Fixes

- Score doesn't reset on reloading level ( I think this is fixed )
- Bug with line clear powerup and jelly tiles that soft locks game
- Next level button doesn't work
- Game can keep playing after game won screen if you make 2 moves
- Maybe you shouldn't be able to make moves while loop is running
- Scene not unloading properly on returning to main menu
- Next level button might be skipping level 2 for some reason

### Low prio

Lives
Watch ads for lives
Spawning tiles animation - add rotation
Add tile switching animation
Fix bug where you get an error trying to switch with no tile
Fix bug where powerups can match
Fix bug where you can show indicator off screen (If I can fix this I think I can move level background back to game scene if I want)
Level select icons
Game won powerups - I might not do this
