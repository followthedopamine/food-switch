## High prio

- PlayerPrefs for audio volumes
- Options menu

### Powerups

- Line clear powerup (animation)
- Line powerup should complete goal and give score

### Sounds

- Trophy level up -- maximize_005 (This one kinda sucks)

### Fixes

- Score doesn't reset on reloading level ( I think this is fixed )
- Bug with line clear powerup and jelly tiles that soft locks game
- Line clear doesn't clear all the way to the top
- Next level button doesn't work
- Shouldn't restart song if song is already playing
- Game can keep playing after game won screen if you make 2 moves
- Maybe you shouldn't be able to make moves while loop is running
- Scene not unloading properly on returning to main menu
- Next level button might be skipping level 2 for some reason

### Low prio

Lives
Watch ads for lives
Spawning tiles animation - add rotation
Add tile switching animation
Fix bug where you get an error trying to switch with no tile
