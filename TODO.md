## High prio

- PlayerPrefs for audio volumes
- Add backgrounds to UI
- Access menu from in game
- Script to make menu button clickable

### Powerups

- Line clear powerup (animation)
- Should be a smoke puff for the lightning square

### Fixes

- Bug with line clear powerup and jelly tiles that soft locks game

### Low prio

- Lives
- Watch ads for lives
- Spawning tiles animation - add rotation
- Fix bug where powerups can match
- Fix bug where you can show indicator off screen (If I can fix this I think I can move level background back to game scene if I want)
- Game won powerups - I might not do this
- Tutorial
- Levels should unlock one at a time instead of all at once
- Restart button / back to main menu button in menu
- Powerups should not interact with each other
- Level 3 easier than level 2
- Display the level number
- Options menu should play sound effect on adjusting sfx slider

#### Obstacles

- Key door

##### Extremely low prio

- Level select icons
- Add tile switching animation

##### Powerups

- Something bouncy

##### Sounds

- Line
- Black hole
- Free Switch

##### Things that I think are fixed but I'm not sure about

- Score doesn't reset on reloading level ( I think this is fixed )
- Scene not unloading properly on returning to main menu
- Sometimes food can spawn on top of other food and powerups too
- Fix bug where you get an error trying to switch with no tile
