## High prio

- PlayerPrefs for audio volumes
- Add backgrounds to UI
- Access menu from in game
- In game menu might need to disable click to drag
- Exit in game menu button needs to change
- Music should change after a while
- Playing too fast causes weird glitches
- 15 and 13 too hard, 14 too easy
- Tutorial
- Black hole animation should be in front of the other items
- Adding (togglable) haptics would improve the experience of getting a match
- A small vibrate when matches happen, and a bigger one when using a powerup
- I can barely tell what's in the ice, probably could make them a bit less opaque
- UI scaling hides the close button on some devices
- It's possible levels aren't unloading properly
- Add proper credits to UI and to README
- Upload web version to itch
- Fix UI scaling

### Powerups

- Line clear powerup (animation)
- Should be a smoke puff for the lightning square

### Fixes

- Bug with line clear powerup and jelly tiles that soft locks game

### Low prio

- Lives
- Watch ads for lives
- Spawning tiles animation - add rotation
- Fix bug where powerups can match
- Fix bug where you can show indicator off screen (If I can fix this I think I can move level background back to game scene if I want)
- Game won powerups - I might not do this
- Levels should unlock one at a time instead of all at once
- Restart button / back to main menu button in menu
- Powerups should not interact with each other
- Level 3 easier than level 2
- Options menu should play sound effect on adjusting sfx slider
- Check if there is 4 of switchable tile and if not shuffle tiles

#### Obstacles

- Key door

##### Extremely low prio

- Level select icons
- Add tile switching animation

##### Powerups

- Something bouncy

##### Sounds

- Line
- Black hole

##### Things that I think are fixed but I'm not sure about

- Score doesn't reset on reloading level ( I think this is fixed )
- Scene not unloading properly on returning to main menu
- Sometimes food can spawn on top of other food and powerups too
- Fix bug where you get an error trying to switch with no tile
